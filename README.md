Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
It is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
It is a structured approach to developing software, focusing on the design, development and maintenance of reliable and efficient software systems.
 Main differences between software engineering and traditional programming lies in the scale and approach.
Traditional programming often involves writing code to solve a specific problem without a comprehensive plan or consideration for long term maintenance and scalability. On the other hand, software engineering encompasses a more systematic and discipline approach to software development, considering the entire software life cycle, including requirement gathering, design, testing, deployment and maintenance


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
I.	Requirement analysis/ Requirement engineering-In this phase the requirement for the software system are gathered from stakeholders. This involves understanding what the software should do and how it should behave.
II.	Design-This include creating a blue prints of systems structure, architecture and functionalities.
III.	Implementation / Coding-Writing code to implement software design.
IV.	Testing –After implementation the software is tested to ensure it meet the specified requirement and functions correctly. Testing helps identify and fix bugs or issues.
V.	Deployment-It is deployed or released to users.
VI.	Maintenance and jobs- After deployment the software requires ongoing maintenance to address any issues, add new features or make enhancement based on user feedback.



Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
•	Flexibility-Agile is flexible and allows for changes throughout the development process while water fall is rigid and changes a challenging to implement once a phase is completed.
•	Customer involvement –Agile involves customers throughout the development process, promoting collaboration and feedback. While water fall has less customer involvement until the final product is delivered.
•	Adaptability-Agile can adapt to changing requirement easily, while water fall is less adaptable to changes once the project start.
                Scenario preference 
•	Agile – Prefer agile for dynamic project e=where requirements are likely to change, and customer feedback is vital. It is suitable for startups, software with evolving needs or project with uncertain requirements 

•	Waterfall –choose waterfall for project with well understood and stable requirement, where a clear plan is essential. It is suitable for project with fixed budget, strict deadline and where changes are costly.



What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
I.	Customer satisfaction –properly defined requirement ensure that the software meet the needs and expectations of the end users, leading to customer satisfaction
II.	Cost and time efficiency-clear requirement help in reducing rework and changes during later stages of development saving time and cost.
III.	Quality assurance –well defined requirement serves as a basis of testing and validation, ensuring the software meets quality standards.
IV.	Communication-requirement act as a communication bridge between stakeholders, developers and testers aligning everyone towards a common goal
V.	Risk management-identifying and addressing requirement early helps in mitigating risk associated with misunderstanding or changes later in the development process

             Software design principles
 In this, requirement engineering plays a crucial role by providing the foundation on which the                                                 design is based. Following good requirement engineering practices ensures that the software design   with the specified requirement, leading t-*/o a well-structured functional and user friendly final product.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity is a fundamental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the component of a system. this helps to localize the impact of changes, simplifies maintenance, and enhances under stability of the system.

How it improves maintainability of software systems
•	Easier update-changes or updates can be made to specific module without affecting other parts of the software
•	Isolation issues-if an issue arises, modular design allows for easier identification and isolation of the problem to a specific module making debugging and troubleshooting more straightforward.
•	Code reusability-it reduce redundancy and promoting consistency across the system
             How it improves scalability of software systems
•	Flexibility-modular design allows for adding new features or scaling the system by simply adding or modifying modules, without impacting the entire software architecture.
•	Parallel development-it speeds up the development process and enabling scalability without bottlenecks.
•	Resource efficiency 


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
I.	unit testing-testing individual modules or component to verify their correctness in isolation.
II.	Integration testing-testing the interaction between modules to ensure they work together as intended.
III.	System testing –testing the entire system as a whole to validate its compliance with requirements.
IV.	Acceptance testing –testing conducted to end users to determine whether the software meets their needs and expectations.

Why it is crucial in software development
Because it identifies potential issues before they reach end users, reducing the likelihood of software failures and associated financial and repetitional risks.
It also helps in identifying existing issues and bugs but also help in tackling future problems that a user might encounter.


What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
I.	History tracking –vcs keep track of changes made to the code over time. This allows developers to view the history of modification, understand why changes were made and revert to previous versions if needed.
II.	Collaboration-teams of developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflict.
III.	Backup and recovery-developers can retrieve previous versions from the repository ensuring data integrity and minimizing the risk of data loss.
IV.	Code quality
V.	Testing and deployment-vcs facilitates testing and deployment processes by
 tagging specific issues or features.
